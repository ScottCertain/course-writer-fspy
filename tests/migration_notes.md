# Test Migration Notes

## Overview

The standalone test scripts from the root directory have been migrated to the organized test framework. The original scripts have been preserved for reference, but new testing should use the structured framework in the `tests/` directory.

## Migrated Tests

| Original Script | Migrated To | Description |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `test_draft_pipeline.py` | `tests/integration/test_draft_pipeline_integration.py` | Tests for the draft pipeline service |
| `test_lesson_pipeline.py` | `tests/integration/test_lesson_pipeline_integration.py` | Tests for the lesson pipeline service |
| `test_pipeline_fixed.py` | `tests/integration/test_pipeline_integration.py` | Tests for the fixed pipeline implementation |
| `test_llm_configuration.py` | `tests/unit/services/test_llm_configuration.py` | Tests for LLM service provider and configuration |

## Test Execution

To run all tests:
```bash
pytest
```

To run specific test categories:
```bash
pytest tests/unit/  # Run all unit tests
pytest tests/integration/  # Run all integration tests
```

## Log Files

All log files are now directed to the `test_logs/` directory. This includes:
- Test execution logs
- Coverage reports
- Pipeline execution logs

## Next Steps

1. Consider archiving or removing the original test scripts from the root directory once all functionality has been verified in the new test structure.
2. Add additional unit tests for other components as needed.
3. Enhance integration tests to cover more scenarios.
