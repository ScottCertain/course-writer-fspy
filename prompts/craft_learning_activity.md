# Craft Learning Activity Prompt Template

## Task
Design a specific learning activity based on the activity outline, focusing on the requested activity type and learning outcomes.

## Activity Outline
$activity_outline

## Activity Type
$activity_type  # e.g., "coding_exercise", "discussion", "research_task", "code_along", etc.

## Learning Outcomes
$learning_outcomes

## Course Context
- Course Title: $course_title
- Target Audience: $target_audience
- Skill Level: $skill_level

## Instructions
1. Create a comprehensive learning activity of the specified type
2. Ensure the activity directly supports one or more learning outcomes
3. Include clear, step-by-step instructions for the learner
4. Provide appropriate scaffolding based on the skill level
5. Design the activity to be engaging and challenging but achievable
6. Include all necessary resources or references
7. Define clear success criteria so learners know when they've completed the activity
8. Add instructor notes where needed for implementation guidance

## Format Guidelines

### For Coding Exercises
- Include a clear problem statement
- Specify requirements and constraints
- Provide starter code if appropriate
- Include test cases or validation criteria
- Add a complete solution with explanatory comments

### For Discussion Activities
- Provide thought-provoking questions
- Include guidance on discussion format and expected depth
- Suggest reference materials for participants
- Include sample responses or discussion points

### For Research Tasks
- Define clear research objectives
- Suggest potential resources or search terms
- Specify expected output format (report, presentation, etc.)
- Include evaluation criteria for the research output

### For Code-Along Activities
- Break down the process into clear, manageable steps
- Include complete code snippets for each step
- Explain what each step accomplishes
- Highlight key concepts being demonstrated
- Include checks for understanding throughout

## Output
A detailed, ready-to-implement learning activity that supports the learning outcomes and engages learners at the appropriate skill level.
