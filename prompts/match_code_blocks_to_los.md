# Match Code Blocks to LOs Prompt Template

## Task
Identify which code blocks from the expanded lesson should be included in a hands-on activity and match them to specific learning outcomes.

## Expanded Lesson
$expanded_draft

## Learning Outcomes
$learning_outcomes

## Course Context
- Course Title: $course_title
- Target Audience: $target_audience
- Skill Level: $skill_level

## Instructions
1. Identify all code blocks within the expanded lesson
2. Assess which code blocks are most appropriate for hands-on activities
3. Match each selected code block to one or more learning outcomes it addresses
4. Evaluate the complexity of each code block relative to the target audience
5. Identify dependencies between code blocks (which ones build upon others)
6. Rate each code block's importance for demonstrating key concepts
7. Suggest any modifications needed to make code blocks better suited for activities
8. Identify any gaps where additional code examples might be needed

## Format
For each recommended code block:
- Include a descriptive label/name for the code block
- Copy the exact code from the lesson
- List the learning outcome(s) it supports
- Provide a brief explanation of why this code block is valuable for activities
- Include difficulty rating (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Note any dependencies on other code blocks
- Suggest any modifications or scaffolding needed

## Output
A structured assessment of code blocks from the lesson matched to learning outcomes, with recommendations for their use in hands-on activities.
