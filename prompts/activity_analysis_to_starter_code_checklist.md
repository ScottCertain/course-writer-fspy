# Activity Analysis to Starter Code Checklist Prompt Template

## Task
Create a comprehensive checklist for developing effective starter code based on an activity analysis.

## Activity Analysis
$activity_analysis

## Activity
$activity

## Learning Outcomes
$learning_outcomes

## Course Context
- Course Title: $course_title
- Target Audience: $target_audience
- Skill Level: $skill_level

## Instructions
1. Extract key requirements for starter code from the activity analysis
2. Identify which code components should be provided vs. created by learners
3. Determine appropriate levels of scaffolding needed in the starter code
4. Identify which concepts should be demonstrated vs. discovered
5. Develop checklist items for code structure, documentation, and comments
6. Include guidance on error handling and edge cases in the starter code
7. Specify any required tests or validation mechanisms
8. Ensure the starter code will support all learning outcomes

## Format
Create a structured checklist with these categories:
- **Code Structure**: Framework and organization requirements
- **Function/Class Stubs**: Which elements to include with implementation left to students
- **Documentation**: What comments and explanations to include
- **Imports and Dependencies**: Required libraries or modules to include
- **Helper Utilities**: Support code that reduces unnecessary complexity
- **Tests**: Test fixtures or validation mechanisms to include
- **Visual Elements**: Any UI or visualization components needed
- **Error Handling**: How much error handling to implement vs. leave to students
- **Completion Indicators**: How students will know they've successfully completed each part

Format each checklist item as:
- [ ] Clear, actionable statement describing what should be included or considered
- Include brief rationale for each item

## Output
A practical, actionable checklist that guides the development of effective starter code, balancing the right level of support with appropriate learning challenges.
