# Activity Rough Draft Prompt Template

## Task
Develop a rough draft of a complete hands-on activity based on the matched code blocks and learning outcomes.

## Matched Code Blocks
$matched_code_blocks

## Learning Outcomes
$learning_outcomes

## Course Context
- Course Title: $course_title
- Target Audience: $target_audience
- Skill Level: $skill_level

## Instructions
1. Create a structured activity that incorporates the matched code blocks
2. Develop a compelling scenario or context for the activity
3. Write clear step-by-step instructions for completing the activity
4. Include appropriate scaffolding based on the target audience's skill level
5. Add appropriate challenges or extensions for advanced learners
6. Ensure the activity directly supports the learning outcomes
7. Include all necessary resources, starter code, and reference materials
8. Develop a complete solution with explanatory comments

## Format
Structure the activity with these sections:
- **Introduction**: Set context and explain the purpose of the activity
- **Learning Objectives**: Specific outcomes this activity addresses
- **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge or setup before beginning
- **Resources Needed**: Tools, libraries, or other materials required
- **Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance, clearly numbered
- **Starter Code**: Any code that should be provided to learners
- **Success Criteria**: How learners will know they've completed successfully
- **Solution**: Complete working implementation with detailed comments
- **Discussion Questions**: Follow-up questions to reinforce learning

Use rich Markdown formatting:
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Format all code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bulleted lists for non-sequential items
- Include appropriate emphasis for key terms or important notes

## Output
A comprehensive rough draft of a hands-on activity that effectively incorporates the code blocks and addresses the learning outcomes.
