## Original Learning Outcomes
$original_learning_outcomes

## Instructions
1. Review the original learning outcomes and compare them to the actual lesson content

6. Refine the wording to better reflect the depth or complexity actually covered
7. Maintain proper alignment with Bloom's Taxonomy appropriate to the content depth
8. Check that the set of outcomes is complete but concise (typically 3-5 outcomes)

- Use an appropriate action verb (explain, identify, analyze, create, etc.)
- Clearly identify what the learner will know or be able to do
- Be formatted as a numbered list

## Output
A refined set of 3-5 learning outcomes that accurately reflect what a learner will gain from the completed lesson.
