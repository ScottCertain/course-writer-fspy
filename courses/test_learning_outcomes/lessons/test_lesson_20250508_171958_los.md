# Learning Outcomes: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

By the end of this module, software developers will be able to:

1. **Define RAG conceptually and architecturally**
   - Explain the fundamental components of a RAG system, including the retriever and generator
   - Compare RAG with traditional LLM approaches, particularly regarding hallucination reduction 
   - Describe the data flow between components in a RAG architecture

2. **Analyze RAG's benefits in modern software applications**
   - Evaluate when RAG is appropriate versus alternative architectures
   - Identify opportunities to enhance existing applications with RAG capabilities
   - Explain how RAG addresses key LLM limitations including knowledge cutoffs and hallucinations
   - Articulate the tradeoffs in performance, accuracy, and complexity when implementing RAG

3. **Design and implement RAG systems in production environments**
   - Select appropriate vector databases and embedding models for a given use case
   - Implement efficient chunking strategies for document processing
   - Apply techniques for query transformation and expansion
   - Develop effective retrieval mechanisms with semantically appropriate similarity measures
   - Integrate custom knowledge bases with LLM capabilities
   - Implement caching strategies to optimize performance and cost

4. **Evaluate and optimize RAG system performance**
   - Apply quantitative metrics to measure retrieval quality
   - Debug common failure modes in RAG systems
   - Implement feedback loops to improve retrieval and generation quality
   - Optimize performance across response quality, latency, and cost
   - Test RAG implementations with various input types and edge cases

5. **Apply best practices for RAG system security and governance**
   - Implement data security patterns for sensitive information access
   - Develop strategies for content filtering and safety
   - Design systems that maintain data freshness and accuracy
   - Apply techniques for source attribution and transparency
