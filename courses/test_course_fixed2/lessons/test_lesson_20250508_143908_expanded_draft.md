# Lesson: Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems 

**Learning Outcomes (LOs):**
- Understand the limitations of traditional language models for open-ended QA
- Learn the motivations and core components behind RAG architectures  
- Gain familiarity with steps for building a basic RAG pipeline

As AI developers, we're no strangers to the "garbage in, garbage out" principle. Feed a traditional language model low-quality or irrelevant training data, and you'll get nonsensical outputs. This poses challenges when handling open-ended questions that require contextual knowledge beyond what's captured in standard LM training sets.  

A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system enhances language model performance on open-domain Q&A by strategically retrieving and conditioning on relevant supplementary context at inference time. Think of it like a coding "rubber duck" that doesn't just blindly parrot model outputs, but also looks up relevant documentation or stackoverflow threads to better respond.

**The Motivation: Limitations of Closed-Book Language Models**

While impressive, even massive language models like GPT-3 trained on broad internet corpora struggle with open-ended queries requiring deep subject matter expertise or up-to-date factual knowledge. Their training samples are inherently stale relative to rapidly evolving world events, products, or technical content.

It's akin to traditional software flying blind without easy access to dependencies, libraries, or official docs. RAG models let us bypass these pitfalls by introducing supplementary context retrieval as part of the model pipeline.

**Core Components of RAG Architectures**

At a high level, RAG combines two core modules:

1. **Retriever**: A neural retriever model that identifies the most relevant passages or documents from a large corpus (e.g. Wikipedia) given an input query.

2. **Reader**: A generative language model that conditions on the query _and_ top retrieved context to generate a final answer.

The magic happens in how these components are composed. Abstractly, for a given query:

```python
## Step 1: Retriever searches corpus for relevant docs/passages
relevant_contexts = retriever.search(query, corpus) 

## Step 2: Reader generates final answer conditioned on query + context
final_answer = reader.generate(query, relevant_contexts)
```

Caching and indexing strategies for the retriever's corpus are crucial for acceptable latency. Common retrievers include TF-IDF baselines or more recently BERT-based bi-encoders or cross-encoders.

**Building a Basic RAG Pipeline**

While full-scale RAG systems rely on models with task-specific fine-tuning on QA datasets, we can approximate the core functionality for basic open-book QA with off-the-shelf components:

1. **Set up retriever**: Load a pre-built retriever model/corpus (e.g. using `transformers` `DensePassageRetriever` class)

2. **Set up reader**: Load a generative LM like `text-davinci-003` that accepts conditioning context 

3. **At inference**: 
    - Pass input query to retriever, get top K relevant chunks
    - Concatenate query and retrieved context for reader
    - Generate reader output as final prediction

This forms the basis of a RAG system. Advanced architectures may introduce re-rankers, differentiable retrievers, or multi-step retrieval stages.

By decoupling information retrieval from language generation, RAG provides a powerful way to enhance LM capabilities for knowledge-intensive tasks by retrieving targeted context, not just relying on its limited training distribution.

**Glossary**

- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**: Language model architecture involving a retriever for fetching relevant context and a generator conditioned on that context.

- **Open-domain QA**: Question-answering task without any constraints on the domains or topics that queries can cover.

- **Retriever**: Component that retrieves relevant documents/passages from a corpus given a query.

- **Reader**: Generative model component that conditions on the original query and retrieved context to produce a final output.
