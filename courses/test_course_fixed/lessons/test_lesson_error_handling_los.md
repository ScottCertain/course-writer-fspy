Here are some detailed learning outcomes for a module on testing error handling in AI applications:

Topic 1: Unit Testing AI Models

LO1: Define unit testing and explain its importance for AI model development
LO2: Describe techniques for unit testing data preprocessing and feature engineering code
LO3: Construct unit tests to validate AI model inputs, outputs, and edge cases
LO4: Utilize testing frameworks like PyTest to write and run AI model unit tests
LO5: Interpret AI model unit test results and debug failures

Topic 2: Integration and System Testing

LO1: Distinguish integration testing from unit testing for AI applications
LO2: Design integration tests for AI model interactions with databases, APIs, and UIs  
LO3: Develop system test plans for end-to-end validation of AI application workflows
LO4: Construct test data sets representing realistic production scenarios 
LO5: Implement monitoring and observability for AI models in test and production

By covering these learning outcomes, experienced developers can learn systematic practices for testing and validating AI models and AI-powered applications. The outcomes blend familiar software testing concepts with AI-specific testing needs. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!
