Here are some potential detailed learning outcomes for a test module on error handling in AI applications:

Topic 1: Error handling fundamentals

LO1: Explain the importance of robust error handling in AI applications
LO2: Differentiate between common error types (e.g. Input errors, model errors, data errors)
LO3: Identify potential sources of errors in the AI application lifecycle

Topic 2: Error handling techniques  

LO4: Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malformed input errors
LO5: Catch and handle exceptions raised by AI models during inference  
LO6: Design monitoring and alerting systems to detect data errors and model drift
LO7: Apply defensive programming practices to create error-resilient code
LO8: Follow security best practices to prevent misuse and vulnerabilities  

Testing and Validation

LO9: Write comprehensive test cases covering different error scenarios
LO10: Validate error handling through fault injection testing
LO11: Analyze application logs and errors for effective debugging

I've aimed to provide a balance of conceptual and practical learning outcomes. We start with fundamentals to build understanding, then cover specific error handling techniques aligned to the AI development process. Testing, validation and debugging aspects are also included.

I've tried to use language and examples relatable to experienced software developers, connecting new AI concepts to familiar programming principles where possible. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!
