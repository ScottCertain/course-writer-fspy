3. Explore implementation strategies for deploying RAG systems in production environments:
   a. Understand the requirements and considerations for setting up the retrieval component (e.g., document corpus, indexing, search engine)
   b. Discuss techniques for fine-tuning and adapting the generation component to the specific domain or task
   c. Examine methods for integrating the retrieval and generation components into a cohesive system
   d. Discuss best practices for serving RAG systems in production (e.g., scalability, latency, model updates)
