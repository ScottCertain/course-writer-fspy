# Lesson: Error Handling for LLMs

Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 can generate impressively fluent text, but sometimes their outputs contain factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or biased content we need to catch. Like any other system, proper error handling is key to making LLMs reliable and robust in production environments.

## Learning Outcomes
After this lesson, you'll be able to:

1. Explain the risks of unmitigated LLM errors
2. Implement defensive testing techniques to validate LLM outputs
3. Interpret failure signals and refine prompts accordingly  

## The Perils of Prompt Naïveté

Out of the box, LLMs have no grounding in reality—they simply regurgitate plausible-sounding prose based on their training data. Without sanity checks, you risk amplifying misinformation, compounding minor flaws into major breakages down the line.

It's like writing JavaScript without types or tests: small lapses can lead to catastrophic bugs and security holes in complex apps. Just as we rigorously safeguard application logic, we must treat LLM outputs with the same scrutiny before shipping to production.

## Defensive Testing Techniques

So how do we validate the integrity of generated text? Here are some battle-tested techniques from the AI testing trenches:

### Output Constraining

The first line of defense is carefully constraining the LLM's response space using targeted prompts. Much like designing robust APIs, you want informative yet restrictive prompt templates that steer outputs toward valid solution domains.

For instance, when generating code samples, your prompt could restrict valid languages, standardize formatting, or enforce naming conventions. The tighter the box, the easier it is to validate outputs.

### Reference Testing

Another powerful approach is reference testing against known-good data sources. For factual queries, you can cross-check LLM outputs against trusted databases or reference materials to catch inaccuracies.

This is akin to integration testing—ensuring your code interoperates correctly with external systems and data providers. The difference is you're validating generative outputs instead of pure functions.

### Discriminator Models 

You can also deploy separate AI discriminators to critique, fact-check, or detect potential issues with the primary LLM's outputs before shipping them.

Picture a quality assurance AI that looks over your main model's shoulder, checking for factual slip-ups, biased language, safety constraints, or other red flags. Much like static analysis tools probing code, these watchdog models can provide an extra safeguard.

## Interpreting Failures

Even with defensive testing, failures are inevitable—no model is perfect. The key is developing intuitions for common error modes so you can debug and refine prompts over time.

For instance, if outputs exhibit fixation or repetition quirks, you may need to adjust temperature sampling or introduce new context.  Factual errors could signal a distributional mismatch between your training data and the target domain. 

Bias and toxicity slips are often rooted in the originating dataset—a reminder to carefully curate and filter corpora. Approaching these model faults methodically, much like traditional debugging flows, will steadily improve reliability.
