# Lesson: Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

_Learning Outcomes:_
- Understand the motivation and use cases for RAG models over standard language models
- Learn the architectural components of a RAG system 
- Explore code examples walking through the query pipeline

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an AI technique that enhances standard language models (like GPT-3) by incorporating information retrieval systems. Traditional language models are purely generative—their outputs are generated word-by-word based solely on the training data. This works well for many language tasks, but can struggle when specific factual knowledge is required that wasn't contained in the model's training set.

Imagine building a customer support chatbot for an e-commerce site. A language model trained on general web data could handle common queries about shipping and returns. But for niche product details or the latest policy updates, it would likely hallucinate or respond inaccurately since that domain knowledge isn't baked into its parameters.

This is where RAG shines. Rather than having the language model fly blind, a RAG system first retrieves relevant документация—like product specs or policy docs—from an auxiliary corpus tailored to the domain. The model then conditions its generation on this contextual information, allowing it to provide more knowledgeable and coherent responses.

In software terms, think of a RAG model like an application server hitting an external data store on each request, instead of working from an embedded local dataset alone. Just as an application stack often combines multiple components, RAG melds generative and retrieval capabilities into a unified knowledge-powered system.

(Technical paragraph expanding on architectural components...)

A RAG system comprises three core modules:

1. **Retriever**: An information retrieval system (based on BM25, TF-IDF, vector search etc.) that retrieves the top-k relevant passages from a corpus given a query. This acts as a dynamic knowledge base lookup.

2. **Reader**: A neural language model (e.g. BERT) that reads the retrieved passages and encodes them into contextual representations.

3. **Generator**: A conditional language model (like GPT) that attends to the reader's contextual encodings when generating its output sequence.  

The typical pipeline flows like: an input query > retriever fetches relevant passages > reader encodes them > generator produces a final output conditioned on the encoded contexts. Developers can use existing components or custom models for each stage.

(Code snippet illustrating a basic RAG implementation...)

```python
# Simple RAG system with off-the-shelf components

# Retriever (BM25 over Wikipedia)
from pyserini.search import SimpleSearcher
corpus = SimpleSearcher.from_prebuilt_index('wikipedia_docs')

# Reader (BERT)
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Generator (GPT-2) 
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
generator = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Query pipeline
query = "What is the capital of France?"
passages = corpus.search(query, k=3) # Retrieve top 3 docs
inputs = tokenizer(passages, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True)
outputs = model(**inputs) # Encode passages with BERT
output_sequences = generator.generate(inputs=outputs.last_hidden_state) # Generate conditioned on passage encodings
```

RAG models are particularly useful in open-domain question answering, dialog systems, and any application requiring dynamic access to large external knowledge sources beyond the language model's ingested training data.
